# 🌍 Echoes of Impact  
### *Visualizing kindness in a world full of negativity.*

---

## 🧠 Overview  
**Echoes of Impact** is a web platform that turns acts of kindness into **visible digital ripples across the world**.  
In a world full of negativity, this project aims to make **positivity visible and contagious**. Every time someone performs a good deed — like planting a tree, donating to a cause, or helping someone in need — they can record it on the platform. Instantly, a **glowing ripple appears on a global map**, symbolizing how their act contributes to the collective good.  
Over time, ripples from users overlap, forming a **living map of kindness** that grows with every new act. Users can comment, react, and get inspired by others’ good deeds — turning empathy into an interactive, gamified experience.
